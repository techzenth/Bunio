1.       We need a clear option for imei upload from excel sheet
2.       There should not be a delete option, the system should be designed to re-assign imei numbers not to delete them.
3.       We need to provide Data for Sim Activation and Digitrak for you to populate the system for proper testing, please note that I will seek assistance to export Digitrak this week so that I can provide this information.
4.       IMEI should be the main link, not the DNumber which is subject to change
5.       There should be a link between the technical table and device table.
